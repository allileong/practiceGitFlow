# Practicing Git Flow

* Checkout your own branch from the master branch. Name the branch something like: &lt;yourName&gt;/&lt;featureName&gt; e.g. 
```
git checkout -b alli/updatingReadMe
```
* Make your changes
* Commit them along the way
```
git commit -a -m "Updating the readme with git flow steps"
```
* When you are satisfied with your changes, do one final commit, and then push them up to the remote repository
```
git push origin alli/updateReadMe
```
* Switch over to the github ui & hit the "Compare & pull request" button
* Select the branch that you would like to merge your change into to be the "base" branch (oftentimes, this will be 'master')
* Fill in the pull request subject box with: &lt;work item number&gt;: &lt;work item description&gt; e.g. "W-123345562: Updating the Readme with git flow steps"
* On the right hand side of the pull request page, click on the gear icon next to "Reviewers" and assign someone to be the reviewer of the PR; click on the "Assignees" gear icon to assign yourself to the PR
* Hit the "Create pull request" button
* Wait for a code review and merge/respond to comments :)
